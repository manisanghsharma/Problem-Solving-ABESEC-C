## Problem Solving in C

I recently switched my attention from practising my Python problem-solving techniques to learning the foundations of programming with the classic language, C. Choosing the HackerRank site as my testing ground, I did a hands on solving all kinds of puzzles and errors I encountered while solving questions. This change reinforced my fundamental programming skills and ignited a fresh passion for data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving (DSA). Through my experience on HackerRank, I was able to improve my programming knowledge and abilities at a fundamental level.

This provided me with the skill set one requires to establish oneself in the world of Software development. This repository will provide you the basic insights of how problem solving is all about with the benefit of some basic questions to practice.
